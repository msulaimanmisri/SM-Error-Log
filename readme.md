## About this plugin
It's really annoying in enable WordPress Debug because I need to go to the root folder, check the wp-config.php and then change the value from `false` into `true`. So that's the main reason why this plugin is born. This plugin will make your WP_DEBUG turn into `true` and you can check in the dashboard or your `wp-content` folder the error (if you want). If you don't want, you can check the error in the WordPress dashboard. This all happen without you leaving WordPress. Make you save tons of time.
